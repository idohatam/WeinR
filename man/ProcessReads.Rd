\arguments{
\item{qc_obj}{A \code{LongReadQC} object containing one or more input files in \code{qc_obj@files},
with corresponding metrics already computed in \code{qc_obj@metrics} and
\code{qc_obj@summary_metrics}.}

\item{filter}{Logical(1). If \code{TRUE}, run \code{FilterLong()} prior to other steps.}

\item{MinAvgQS}{Numeric(1). Minimum mean per-read quality score to keep a read
(passed to \code{FilterLong()}).}

\item{MinLength}{Integer(1). Minimum read length to keep a read (passed to \code{FilterLong()}).}

\item{MaxNumberNs}{Integer(1). Maximum number of \code{N} bases allowed per read
(passed to \code{FilterLong()}).}

\item{AdapterSeq}{Character(1) or \code{NULL}. If not \code{NULL}, run \code{RemoveAdapter()} using
this adapter sequence.}

\item{MaxMismatchEnd}{Integer(1). Maximum mismatches allowed in end-adapter matches
(passed to \code{RemoveAdapter()}).}

\item{MinOverlapEnd}{Integer(1). Minimum overlap length for end-adapter matches
(passed to \code{RemoveAdapter()}).}

\item{MinInternalDistance}{Integer(1). Minimum distance between internal adapter sites
(passed to \code{RemoveAdapter()}).}

\item{MinFragmentLength}{Integer(1). Minimum fragment length to keep after internal
adapter trimming (passed to \code{RemoveAdapter()}).}

\item{Start}{Integer(1) or \code{NULL}. If not \code{NULL}, trim this many bases from the 5' end
(passed to \code{TrimLong()}).}

\item{End}{Integer(1) or \code{NULL}. If not \code{NULL}, trim this many bases from the 3' end
(passed to \code{TrimLong()}).}

\item{OutFileType}{Character vector specifying output format(s) to write when outputs
are written (e.g., \code{"fastq"}). Supported values are \code{"fastq"},
\code{"bam"}, and \code{"fasta"} (as implemented by \code{WriteReadOutputs()}).}

\item{outpath}{Character(1). Basename for the report output (without extension).
Reports are written to \code{file.path(getwd(), "WeinR_Outputs", "Reports", outpath)},
producing \code{.Rmd} and \code{.html}.}

\item{title}{Character(1). Title used in the generated report. Defaults to \code{outpath}.}

\item{render_report}{Logical(1). If \code{TRUE}, generate an HTML report with \code{Reporter()}.}

\item{force}{Logical(1). If \code{FALSE} and an existing report \code{.Rmd} or \code{.html} already exists
for \code{outpath}, the function errors. If \code{TRUE}, allows overwrite.}

\item{verbose}{Logical(1). If \code{TRUE}, print progress messages for each file and step.}

\item{KeepIntermediates}{Logical(1). If \code{TRUE}, keep intermediate FASTQ files produced
between steps (when step functions are called with \code{WriteIntermediate = TRUE}).
If \code{FALSE}, intermediates are cleaned up after each file.}

\item{FinalSuffix}{Character(1). Suffix used for the final output file produced by the
last step that runs (e.g., \code{"processed"}).}
}
\value{
The updated \code{LongReadQC} object with per-file metadata updated in \code{qc_obj@metadata}.
Processed reads are written under \code{file.path(getwd(), "WeinR_Outputs", "Processed_Files")}
by the underlying step functions.
}
\description{
Runs an end-to-end processing workflow over all files in a \code{LongReadQC} object.
For each input file, the workflow can (optionally) apply read filtering
(\code{FilterLong()}), adapter trimming (\code{RemoveAdapter()}), and 5'/3' end trimming
(\code{TrimLong()}), chaining steps via temporary FASTQ files when intermediate writing
is enabled. After processing all files, an HTML report can be generated via
\code{Reporter()}.
}
\details{
\strong{Workflow order (per file):}
\enumerate{
\item Optional filtering with \code{FilterLong()} if \code{filter = TRUE}.
\item Optional adapter trimming with \code{RemoveAdapter()} if \code{AdapterSeq} is provided.
\item Optional 5'/3' trimming with \code{TrimLong()} if \code{Start} and/or \code{End} are provided.
}

Steps may be chained using temporary FASTQ files stored as
\code{attr(single_qc, "._tmp_fastq")} produced by \code{FilterLong()} / \code{RemoveAdapter()}.
Temporary files are cleaned up automatically after each file

If a step results in \code{reads_after == 0L} (as recorded in the step summary in metadata),
remaining steps for that file are skipped and the workflow continues to the next input file.
