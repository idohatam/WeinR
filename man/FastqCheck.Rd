\title{Sniff a FASTQ/FASTQ.GZ file for basic structural validity}
\usage{
FastqCheck(filePath, n_records = 100L)
}
\arguments{
\item{filePath}{Character(1). Path to a \code{.fastq}, \code{.fq}, or gzipped
equivalent (\code{.gz}).}

\item{n_records}{Integer(1). Number of FASTQ records to inspect. Must be a
single positive integer (>= 1).}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{TRUE} on success. Errors if the file appears
malformed. An empty file is treated as valid and returns \code{TRUE}.
}
\description{
Internal helper that reads the first \code{n_records} FASTQ records and checks
basic file structure:
\itemize{
\item Records occur in groups of four lines
\item Header lines (line 1 of each record) start with \code{"@"}
\item Plus lines (line 3 of each record) start with \code{"+"}
}
}
\details{
This function is intended as a lightweight corruption check and does not
validate sequence/quality lengths or encoding.

The function reads at most \code{n_records * 4} lines from the file. If the
number of lines read is not a multiple of four, or if header or plus lines do
not conform to FASTQ conventions, an error is raised with an informative
message.

\dontrun{
# Valid minimal FASTQ
fq <- tempfile(fileext = ".fastq")
writeLines(c("@r1", "ACGT", "+", "IIII"), fq)
FastqCheck(fq)

# Malformed FASTQ (missing plus line)
bad <- tempfile(fileext = ".fastq")
writeLines(c("@r1", "ACGT", "IIII"), bad)
FastqCheck(bad)
